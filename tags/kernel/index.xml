They&amp;rsquo;re considered &amp;ldquo;containers&amp;rdquo; because the Linux kernel applies isolation boundaries around them. Through this isolation, each process has its own view of system resources, such as processes, networking, and filesystems, creating the illusion that it&amp;rsquo;s running on its own machine. In reality, all containers share the same host kernel.
This model of containerization is primarily enabled by two kernel features: namespaces, which provide resource isolation, and cgroups, which control and limit resource usage.</description></item></channel></rss>

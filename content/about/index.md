# Martin Stoynov

My philosophy is that true expertise comes from mastering fundamentals, practicing relentlessly, and viewing every challenge as an opportunity to learn. I believe in breaking complex concepts into simple, meaningful insights, reinforcing them through consistent practice, and transforming failed attempts into iterative, structured progress.
